-- GITFLOW DESCRIPTION --
This is a simple explanation of the branch hierarchy.

There will be one master branch just for final implementations
that are tested before committing. The branch one level lower
in the hierarchy is called "Development" and it is used as the
merge "hub" from the Front-end (branch) and Back-end (branch).

Front-end: is the main branch of the contributor that will be working
on the interface of the project in Angular. Each contributor will have
its own branch for developing specific features. Ones the feature is 
complete they will commit to the Front-end branch and then after merging
their work they will update their own corresponding branches.

Back-end: is the main branch of the contributors that will be working
on the database of the project in Mongo. Same as the front end but 
their corresponding branch is called Back-end
